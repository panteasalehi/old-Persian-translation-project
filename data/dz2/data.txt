King Darius says: I am a Persian; setting out from Persia, I conquered Egypt.note I ordered to dig this canal from the river that is called Nilenote and flows in Egypt, to the sea that begins in Persia. Therefore, when this canal had been dug as I had ordered, ships went from Egypt through this canal to Persia, as I had intended.
