King Darius says: This is what was done by me in Babylon.
King Darius says: This is what I have done. By the grace of Ahuramazda have I always acted. After I became king, I fought nineteen battles in a single year and by the grace of Ahuramazda I overthrew nine kings and I made them captive.
One was named Gaumâta, the Magian; he lied, saying 'I am Smerdis, the son of Cyrus.' He made Persia to revolt.
Another was named Âššina, the Elamite; he lied, saying: 'I am king the king of Elam.'
