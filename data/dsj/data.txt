I am Darius the great king, king of kings, king of all nations, king of this earth, the son of Hystaspes, an Achaemenid.
King Darius says: All that I did, I did not do otherwise than was the desire of Ahuramazda. Thus I did. Ahuramazda was a friend to me. Everything I did, was successful for me.
King Darius says: By the favor of Ahuramazda, may this palace seem excellent to everyone who sees it. May Ahuramazda protect me and my country.
